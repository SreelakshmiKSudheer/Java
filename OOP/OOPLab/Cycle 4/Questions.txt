Programs on Packages
1. Write a Java program which contains three classes A, B and Main. The 
class A is in package ‘packageone’ and contains a method 
‘methodClassOne’ that prints a message stating that it is printed from 
class A. Similarly, class B is in package ‘packagetwo’ and contains a 
method ‘methodClassTwo’ that prints a message stating that it is printed 
from class B. The Main class imports these classes, creates their
instances and invokes their corresponding methods.
2. Consider a scenario where an interface named ‘Animal’ is in a package
named ‘animalpackage’ and it declares two methods ‘get_cries’ and 
‘get_eating_type’ that are place holders for printing the cry and eating 
type of animals. The subpackages of ‘animalpackage’ are ‘herbivorous’
and ‘carnivourous’. The ‘herbivorous’ package contains two classes 
‘Cow’ and ‘Elephant’ that implements the ‘Animal’ interface. Similarly, 
the ‘carnivourous’ package contains ‘Lion’ and ‘Bear’ that too implement 
the interface. Design a Main class that import these classes and invokes 
the corresponding methods.
